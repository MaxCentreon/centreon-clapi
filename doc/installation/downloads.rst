Generally speaking, Open Source softwares by Centreon are provided in three possible formats:

* binary RPM packages (recommended)
* tarballs with sources
* Subversion git/repository

RPM packages are the best format you can get as you would not 
have to worry about compilation and installation, everything is
already made by Centreon' experts.

If your platform is not currently supported by RPMs you might
consider using tarball sources which are always provided for stable
release. However, compilation has to be done manually and it can be
cumbersome in some situations.

The latter of these formats is for developers or beta-testers only. No official
support is provided on them as they are most likely still under development.
